            Classic novels have had a profound impact on literature, shaping its themes, structures, and styles while providing a foundation for modern storytelling. Works like <strong>Pride and Prejudice</strong> by Jane Austen delve into <em>love, social class, and the complexities of human relationships,</em> redefining romantic fiction with its wit and exploration of societal norms. <strong>Moby-Dick</strong> by Herman Melville explores the <em>themes of obsession, revenge, and humanity's struggle against nature,</em> offering a deeply symbolic narrative. Similarly, <strong>To Kill a Mockingbird</strong> by Harper Lee examines <em>racial injustice, moral courage, and the loss of innocence,</em> becoming a cornerstone for socially conscious literature. These timeless books not only influenced countless writers but also enriched readers' understanding of universal truths, ensuring their enduring relevance.
