        <p align="center"><b>To Kill a Mockingbird</b> by Harper Lee is a timeless novel that explores themes of racial injustice, morality, and the loss of innocence in the American South during the 1930s. The story is narrated by Scout Finch, a young girl growing up in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama. Through her eyes, readers witness the complexities of human behavior and prejudice as her father, Atticus Finch, a principled lawyer, defends Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. The novel poignantly examines the destructive power of racism and the courage it takes to stand against societal norms. With its compelling characters and profound moral lessons, To Kill a Mockingbird remains a powerful exploration of empathy, justice, and human decency.</p>
